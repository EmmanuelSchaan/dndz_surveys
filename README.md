# dndz_surveys

Plot the redshift distributions of various galaxy surveys, including CMASS, WISE, LSST, DESI, SPHEREx.
Get dN/dz [dimensionless], dN/dzdOmega [galaxies / arcmin2], dN/dV [galaxies / comoving (Mpc/h)3].
These may be out of date, use at your own risk!

Clone and run: ```python driver_dndz.py```
or just look at ```driver_dndz.ipynb```
